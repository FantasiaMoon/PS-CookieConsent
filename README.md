Cookie Consent Module for Prestashop 1.6 and under.

== Description ==

**WP/CC Cookie Consent**

Prestashop unofficial Cookie Consent Module.

It is designed to help you comply with the EU Cookie Law and not make you want to kill yourself in the process. So I made it fast, free, and relatively painless.
Developed by Badr TOUNZI.

**Why required this plugin for my site?**

From October 2015 a new privacy law came into effect across the EU. The law requires that websites ask visitors for consent to use most web cookies.
More information please read this: [EU Cookies Law](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm)

**Why Cookie Consent?**

*Free & open source*

You're forever free to copy, modify and even sell Cookie Consent.

*Lightweight*

Just 20k when minified, and you don't need JQuery or anything else.

**Contribute**

Contributing code is both an important and effective way to improve the **CC Cookie Consent** project and its capabilities.

You can fork the plugin or [open a new issue / feature request](https://github.com/FantasiaMoon/PS-CookieConsent/issues).
